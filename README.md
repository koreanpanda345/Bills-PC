# Bill's PC

What is Bill's PC? rather the main question is what is on it? That's something we all wonder when we first meet the famous NPC called Bill. The moment we had to help him change back to a human after his fail attempt causing him to switch bodies with a Clefairy, we were wondering what does his PC contain? Well that was more of a joke, but you might be wondering what is on it. The answer is quite simple. you know how in Pokemon SwSh when Sonia gives you the Pokemon Box Link, imagine that but for Pokemon Showdown. The strongest thing about it is the fact that it can back up your Pokemon Showdown teams in to your ever own 'PC'. \(We all know Bill was the inventor of the Pokemon Storage right? or is that just me?\) But that is not all, It also has a program called, Pokedex.\(No I totally didn't steal that from any where, Idk what your talking about ðŸ˜“\) It allows you to look up a Pokemon. I did more digging in to Bill's PC when Bill wasn't looking and I found something interesting. It was a Program called Damage Calculator, And at the bottom, it says that it is Powered by Smogon. ðŸ¤” Is Bill secretly working with Smogon? But the program was pretty cool, and lets you calculate damage outputs from a Pokemon to another Pokemon.

## What is Bill's PC?

I mean that's a question that we all have. what is it, or what is on it? But the answer is simple. it's a discord bot. but not just any discord bot. A discord bot design to make Competivite pokemon so much easier. You maybe wondering, "How?". And the answer is simple as well, the best feature it has, is the ability to store your teams into the "PC", that will stay they no matter what. So no more losing your teams, when showdown decides to delete your teams. Sounds cool right?

## Why did you make Bill's PC

This might be a question, and it might not be, but explaining it, might help you see why I decide to make this. The main reason I made this wasn't cause I wanted to be famous, or use this to make money. That's never the cause for me, I do things different. The reason is that i noticed how often people have their teams being wiped, or having troubles with moving teams from one device to another, or simply, need tools that will help them get better. That's why I decide to make this, I made this cause I wanted to make something that will help people, you don't even need to be heavily competitive in pokemon to use, anyone can use it.

## What do I do different than other Developers

This question may sound like I am promoting myself, but the truth is, I am but in a different way. I do things my own way, and I like doing them. But the things I do differently:

* I listen to what people have to say.

  Yes other people do this, but I listen to everyone. If you have a suggestion, I want to hear it. No matter if it is stupid or not, I want to hear it.

* I do not ask for money, nor do I expect donations.

  This is something me personally have a strong feeling about doing. My belif is that you donate cause you like the bot. You are showing you support by allowing it to continue being run.

  100% of the donation The bot gets, will 100% be for the bot, I do not use any of it for my personal gain. It feels wrong for me to do this, so I don't do it.

* Interaction with the community

  This is something that others do, but like this is important to me. I chose to interact with people. I enjoy talking to people, and learning stuff from people. To me, it's why I chose to make this.

* I Give Credit.

  This is something I don't see a lot. I will always give people credit. To me, it's something that just feels right, and makes it seem like I did all this by myself, cause I obivous didn't.
